            <h2>Squirtle Sprayer</h2>
            <p>
              I 3D printed a life-sized Squirtle figure that actually sprays water!  
              This was a fun combination of circuit design, programming, and pnematics.

        <div class="project">
            <h2>GestureAR</h2>
            <p>The code combines finger tracking with gesture recognition to control an LED based on finger positions relative to detected faces. It also integrates augmented reality by overlaying glasses on detected faces in real-time video streams.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Hermes Lens</h2>
            <p>The goal of the Hermes Lens is to simplify language translation by using a wearable pair of glasses that can take in outside text and translate it to your preferred language.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>O.S.M.D (Optical-Scanning-Mathematic-Service)</h2>
            <p>Created a device that can scan and solve mathematical problems using a Pi Camera and Math-Pix API to process and identify the math being scanned
